## Overview

This repository contains the materials and code, which focuses on deploying machine learning models using Flask. I developed a project to predict flight prices. I interpreted learning curves, evaluated and selected models, creating a web application with Flask, and deploying the app using Render.

## Project Details

### Learning Curves and Model Evaluation

- **Understanding Learning Curves**: I explored how learning curves can be used to identify underfitting and overfitting in models.
- **Model Selection**: I used learning curves to evaluate various models and select the best-performing one for our SKYFARE ANALYZER task.

### Web Application Development

- **Flask**: I built a web application using the Flask framework.
- **WTForms**: I integrated WTForms for handling web forms and input validation.
- **HTML Templates**: I utilized HTML templates with Jinja2 for dynamic content rendering.
- **Template Inheritance**: I applied template inheritance to create reusable and maintainable templates.

### API Serving and Deployment

- **Model Serving**: The trained machine learning model was served as an API using Flask.
- **Deployment**: The final Flask application was deployed using Render, making the web app accessible online.
